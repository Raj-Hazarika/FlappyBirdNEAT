# FlappyBirdNEAT
A neural network program to play the game of flappy bird. The algorithm used here is known as NEAT, which stands for NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies.

## About the project

A project that uses NEAT to evolve a Flappy Bird AI would involve using the NEAT algorithm to train a neural network that controls the bird's movements. The network would be trained using a genetic algorithm, where the AI's parameters (weights and biases) are evolved over time to improve its performance in the game.

The project would start by generating a population of randomly initialized neural networks, each controlling a bird in the game. The networks would play the game and their performance would be measured by a fitness function, such as the number of pipes passed or the distance flown. The networks that performed better would have a higher chance of being selected for the next generation.

The selected networks would then be used to generate new networks through genetic operations such as mutation and crossover, which would introduce new variations and combinations of the networks' parameters. These new networks would then play the game and the process would repeat.

As the generations progress, the AI's performance would improve as it evolves to better handle the game's challenges. Eventually, the AI would become skilled enough to beat the game, and the project would be complete. This project can be used as a benchmark for the game AI and can be used to improve the game experience.
